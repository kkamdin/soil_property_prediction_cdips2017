# Soil Property Prediction - CDIPS-DSW 2017

#### [Binder](beta.mybinder.org)-deployed repository of educational notebooks for data science based on [Africa Soil Information Service](http://africasoils.net/services/data/soil-databases/)'s [kaggle competition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/afsis-soil-properties).

These notebooks are an educational tool
for folks who are interested in learning more about
data science in Python.
They serve as an introduction to using
[scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org)
to build, fit, and select between
machine learning models,
using the problem of predicting
the chemical properties
of soil from
[infrared spectral measurements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_spectroscopy).

If you open
[this link](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/kkamdin/soil_property_prediction_cdips2017/master)
in an incognito browser window you'll be dropped into a
fully-fledged, interactive computational environment
where you can run these notebooks, free of charge!

Alternatively, you can view static versions
of the notebooks online, via this GitHub repo,
or you can clone this repo to your own machine
and use the
`requirements.txt`
file to install the dependencies
with `pip`.

This project was a part of the
[2017 Data Science Workshop](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/2017-cdips-data-science-workshop/)
organized by the
[Career Development Initiative in the Physical Sciences](http://cdips.physics.berkeley.edu/).
